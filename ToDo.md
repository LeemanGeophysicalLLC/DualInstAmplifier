# To-Do

Things to think about/fix on this project:

* Change silkscreen from +/- 15V to +/- Vout
* Change pin headers to standard footprint and remove bottom silkscreen
* Further test/modify solder jumpers to make easier to use
* Order parts for higher Fc filter
* Possibly space diodes out further and increase hole size slightly
